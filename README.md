Hello! My name is Cut Syifa Salvira and this app is dedicated for Advotics Front-end coding test.

## How to Use
To run this application, you need to run command below:
``` bash
$ npm install
$ npm run serve
```
Yes, that's it. Only two commands!

If you still think that's too much effort, you could also run:
``` bash
$ npm i && npm run serve
```
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

Thank you!
